Streamlined Localized User Interface

Luminance HDR is available in the following languages:

- Chinese

- OpenEXR (.exr)
- Radiance RGBE (.hdr)

Additionally Raw images can be opened (using LibRaw) as both HDR and LDR images.


Supported LDR File Formats
==========================

Luminance HDR can also write Exif metadata to JPEG, PNG and TIFF files using Exiv2.


Extensive Help System
=====================

We don't really pretend that HDR imaging is easy. It surely can be easy if lousy results is what you want.
For the rest of you we bundle a solid help system to help you getting the most of your pictures.

The help system is, again, localizable. Right now only English version is available,
but you can contribute a translation into your native language, if you really want to.

- you may install Luminance HDR on as many computers as you can reach;
