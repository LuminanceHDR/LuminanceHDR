Workflow

Luminance HDR imposes a particular workflow for HDR imaging. Basically it separates the workflow into two stages:
creation of an HDR image and its conversion to an LDR image. Both :doc:`creation <creating_hdr.html>`
and :doc:`tone mapping<tonemapping.html>` of HDR images can be interactive (using GUI) and non-interactive (using console).

or those photographers who tend to shoot in similar lighting conditions the workflow
can be greatly enhanced by using tonemapping settings files. This allows loading previously
used tonemapping settings when doing interactive tonemapping and :doc:`Batch Tone Mapping <tonemapping_batch.html>` already available HDR images.
