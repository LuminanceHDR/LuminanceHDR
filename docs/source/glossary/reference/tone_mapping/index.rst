Tonemapping Operators
*********************

Luminance HDR is based on pfstmo backend that implements algorithms from published scientific papers on HDR imaging.
Most HDR tools are based on these papers, but Luminance is kind of different in a way that it actually
uses terminology from the papers. Which means that if you are not a PhD in color science,
you need a good explanation, otherwise you are lost.

This section helps understanding underlying algorithms
and explains how to better use a particular tonemapping operator.
